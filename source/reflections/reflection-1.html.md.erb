# Reflection #1: The Assessment

The initial assessment was an enlightening comedy of errors. In my efforts to get the experiment underway the initial assessment was done hastily, causing several small mistakes, as well as a blunder that was as interesting as it was humbling.

## The small mistakes

In an effort to get the ball rolling, I practiced the major, harmonic minor, and melodic minor scale on the traditional keyboard (TK) on July 8th. It was premature, as I would only complete the framework for practicing and publishing results four months later. Mistakes peppered the initial assessment from lack of preparation and because I was doing something relatively complex for the first time. I practiced hands apart before practicing hands together, which I no longer include as a metric.[^1] I didn't give myself much of an opportunity to learn whatever I was testing myself on. My notation of my accomplishments was poor, and I was keeping track of what I would practice, not what I was able to do.[^2]

## The blunder

In these first assessments, I found that I was able to play five scales with hands separate at 60bpm with 8th notes: C major, A major, D melodic minor, G harmonic minor, and D harmonic minor. Five days later I practiced the natural minor scale on the TK, and I found that I was able to play the D natural minor at 60bpm and A natural minor at 76bpm (both 8th notes). This was considerably better than I was able to do the week before. I couldn't play the C Major scale hands together at 60bpm while I could play A natural minor at 76bpm (which has identical fingering). Something was fishy, so I reviewed my notes for the first assessment. This is where the mistakes were made.

Due to my poor notation, I thought that I had actually played all of the major scales with 16th notes rather than 8th notes, and that I was able to play them with both hands at 60 bpm. This would have explained my leap in improvement between the two assessments.

So assuming that I had done the first major scale assessment incorrect, I did a third assessment with 8th notes covering the same content as the first assessment. While playing the scales I gave myself a little bit more time to become familiar with the content.

The results of this experiment sufficiently confused me. I was able to play the C Major scale with 16th notes, and I was able to play four other major scales, two melodic minor scales, and two harmonic minor scales with hands together 8th notes at 60bpm or above. I had performed considerably better than I did on the natural minor scale but it appeared as if I had done substantially worse than the first TK assessment.

This lead me to do what I should have done the first time I questioned my results: listen to the initial assessments. And thus I discovered that I played with 8th notes in my first assessment.

This still left a question: why did I improve so much between the each assessment?

## A return to form

In the second two practice sessions I took more time become familiar with the material before I assessed myself. Also the impact of a few juicy REM cycles shouldn't be underestimated, but neither of these can fully explain the massive improvement. In around an hour (**CHECK THIS)** of assessing, I had gone from 0 completed increments to 53. In retrospect, I can see that in the next eight hours of practicing scales (over the next 32 practice sessions), I only completed 50 increments.

I believe that I improved quickly because I was not learning these skills for the first time. Instead it was a return to form, my brain reclaiming my keyboard skills after a year of stagnation. The speed of improvement, although aided by REM cycles and practice, is mostly due to fact that I was not learning these skills but remembering them.

This means my initial assessment might not be nearly as useful as I thought. I did this assessment to get an initial snapshot of how good I am at each keyboard. But if this is any indication, I might continue to improve rapidly on the TK (and possibly the LIK) in the early practice sessions as I return to the level that I was at about a year ago.[^3]

Despite the multitude of mistakes, the initial assessment provided what I wanted and more: it is an snapshot of my initial abilities, and it taught me that the improvement in the early practice sessions could be explosive, and should be taken with a grain of salt.

[^1]: By the time I recorded the second assessment, I was going through the process of removing the metric of playing hands apart at 60bpm. Now the easiest increment for a scale is 60bpm hands together, and I do not assess if I am able to hands apart. I chose this because I figured that I should be practicing hands together whenever possible. If I can't practice hands together then I will play hands apart at my own tempo, before practicing hands together at my own tempo. From there I would increase tempo until I had 60bpm.

[^2]: This meant that if I could play the C major scale at 60bpm, I would notate C major at 63 bpm (the next increment), rather than 60bpm (what I could actually play). I continued making this error in my assessment, keeping track of what I was going to practice rather than what I was able to do. This was fixed post-assessment. When inputting data, I didn't listen to what I said or notated and instead I listened through my assessments a second time through to determine what I was able to do.

[^3]: Looking back, it appears I had reclaimed most of my previous skill in the assessment. My improvement on the major scale in the first six practice sessions was minimal. However, it is possible that I see similar bursts in improvement when I initially begin practicing the other minor scales.
