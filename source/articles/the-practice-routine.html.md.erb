# The Practice Routine

## Developing the curriculum

I want to test the keyboards with three main domains
of musical prowess: fundamentals, sight reading, and playing by ear.
Fundamentals is the ability of the pianist to play musical patterns,
while sight reading and playing by ear are more about how the pianist
determines what to play given the input of written or sounded music.

When choosing the exercises to practice, I take a couple things into consideration. I value exercises that are in canon or popular, as I don’t want to practice things that are wildly different from what is standard. I also want content that is somewhat diverse so I can exercise and evaluate different skills. Focusing on one type of exercise could highlight certain weaknesses of a keyboard but would create blind spots in my assessments.

### Fundamentals

Taking these values into consideration, for the fundamentals I chose to practice scales and arpeggios, Hanon: The Virtuoso Pianist
in Sixty Exercises, and Slonimsky's Thesaurus of Scales and Musical
Patterns.

Scales and the arpeggios were the easiest decision, as they the most
standard set of exercises. I'm going to be practicing major, melodic
minor, harmonic minor, and natural minor scales in two octaves, and
major and minor arpeggios.

It was also easy to choose to practice Hanon. It is also a very popular
set of exercises, and Hanon will help me determine how difficult it will
be to achieve equitable finger agility on the LIK. Unlike scales, the
LIK will have no transpositional advantage, and will probably be
disadvantaged, as almost all of the exercises in the book are in the key
of C major, which should make it easier on the traditional keyboard.

The last set of exercises by Slonimsky is one that I find fascinating.
Chosen for its unique content rather than popularity, the Thesaurus
should do well to expose technical limitations on either keyboard. If
there was any content that is not written for the traditional keyboard,
it would be the Thesaurus.

### Sight Reading and Playing By Ear

Sight reading and playing by ear are difficult to find exercises for as
they have the unique challenge of being unrepeatable. The second time
sight reading or playing a piece of music by ear will be easier than the
first, the performer will have familiarity with it the second time
through. Thus it is unfair to compare two keyboards with the same music.
For parity, the content must be new.

EarMaster 7 is software that addresses this problem, as it generates
music to be sight read or played by ear from predefined parameters. This
allows me to practice music that has a general difficulty that is
completely unique. The software isn't perfect, (I would like to practice sight reaing with chords) but it's what I'm going
to work with for the moment.

## Method of practicing

I will practice each set of exercises for the same amount of time (and
thus each domain of musical prowess for the same amount of time), but I
won't force myself to practice the same exercise for the same amount of
time, so each keyboard will be allowed to improve at its own pace. I'm
going to be alternating the order that I play the keyboards if I play
both keyboards in the same day to avoid a potentially confounding
variable.[^1]

I have broken up each exercises into a set of incrementing difficulties. For fundamentals this means increasing tempo. The increments are created from my metronome markings, which are increase the speed by about 2-4%. Sight reading and playing by ear is a little bit more complex as increments can change the ambitus and largest intervals as well as the tempo.

## An imperfect, malleable practice routine

There is content that I would like to assess that this is missing from
the curriculum. Notably, I'm not going to be practicing chords at all,
and I think that it will be a necessary addition in the future. I also
might want to compare the keyboards using real songs, etudes, or solos
in the future.

Changing the exercises midway through the experiment will complicate the
results of the experiment. The rate of improvement is best measured with
increments that both keyboards practiced (as it removes the confounding
variable of measuring with increments that can have varying difficulty), and switching exercises will all but ensure that there are unpracticed increments on one of the keyboards.

However, I do not think that this will completely spoil the data from
the experiment, and it is better than the alternative of an immutable
curriculum. The content of the practice sessions will have to change
over time to accommodate my improvement as well as my initial mistakes
in choosing content. I am not going to pursue the ideal of a static,
unimprovable practice routine in favor of a dynamic practice routine
with imperfect results.

## The curriculum

After all this deliberation over what I would practice, here is the
schedule I came up with:

-   5 minutes of scales and arpeggios

-   5 minutes of Hanon

-   5 minutes of the Thesaurus of Scales and Musical Patterns

-   10 minutes of sight reading

-   10 minutes of playing by ear

**Edit from 4/29/19**: And I never actually practiced that curriculum. I changed the curriculum for my first practice session, and after a few sessions I have settled with this schedule:

-   15 minutes of scales and arpeggios

-   15 minutes of Hanon

-   15 minutes of sight reading

-   15 minutes of playing by ear

I have been practicing considerably more than I initially planned, so I
now play each keyboard for an hour. On top of this, I am not practicing
the Thesaurus. Although it is one of the more interesting exercise sets, I
realized how little time fifteen minutes is (let alone five), and I
concluded that I should put this valuable time towards scales and Hanon
instead.

## Conclusion

I chose exercises to asses fundamentals, sight reading, and playing by
ear with reputation and diversity in mind. I recognize that
the chosen content isn't perfect or complete, so I fully expect the
curriculum to change throughout the experiment.

I am using this [Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrjk2lTpQWFpgd26) to keep track of all of my improvement. You can find all of the exercises and all of the increments there. You can find the recording for any practice session [here](https://mega.nz/#F!DPpURACa!FXS_QgmHHKKOW-PCa_wI3A). You can also keep track of my practice sessions from [the practice session section of this site](https://linearisomorphickeyboard.io/practice-sessions).


[^1]: There is a potential confounding variable in the order that I practice the keyboards if I practice both in the same day. If I always play the LIK first and the TK second, the LIK might benefit from my mind being fresh, or the TK might benefit from me already being warmed up. I am going to keep track of each time I practice both keyboards in one day, so the next time I practice both keyboards I can alternate the order.
