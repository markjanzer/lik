              <div class="article-content two-line-clamp">There may be a better way to design the piano. It is known that to master an instrument you must learn to play it in every key. The first key a new pianist will learn to play is the key of C major. It is wonderfully simple: just play the white notes. But...</div>

              <div class="article-content two-line-clamp">I think that the linear isomorphic keyboard (LIK) will outperform the traditional keyboard (TK). I predict that I will improve faster on the LIK than on the traditional keyboard and that the LIK will not have significant technical limitations in comparison to the traditional keyboard.

              <div class="article-content two-line-clamp">I had a few things in mind when developing the curriculum for the keyboards to practice. Most importantly, I want to address the three main domains of musical prowess, the technical aspect of being able to play (addressed by fundamentals), and the two primary ways we determine what to play, sight reading and playing by ear.</div>

              <div class="article-content two-line-clamp">One of the cardinal sins of productivity is to do what has already been done. But in my quest to test an isomorphic keyboard against the traditional keyboard, I appear to have sinned. Isomorphic keyboards have existed since the the early nineteenth century when an isomorphic layout was applied to the button accordions or concertina.</div>
