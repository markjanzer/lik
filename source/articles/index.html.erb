        <div class="article-content">There may be a better way to design the piano. It is known that to master an instrument you must learn to play it in
every key. The first key a new pianist will learn to play is the key of
C major. It is wonderfully simple: just play the white notes. But...</div>

        <div class="article-content">I think that the linear isomorphic keyboard (LIK) will outperform the
traditional keyboard (TK). I predict that I will improve faster on the
LIK than on the traditional keyboard and that the LIK will not have
significant technical limitations in comparison to the traditional
keyboard. More specifically...</div>

        <div class="article-content">I am conducting an experiment to determine whether or not the Linear
Isomorphic Keyboard is easier to play than the traditional piano
keyboard. In order to compare the Linear Isomorphic Keyboard (LIK) and the
traditional keyboard (TK), I am going to practice... </div>

        <div class="article-content">I had a few things in mind when developing the curriculum for the
keyboards to practice. Most importantly, I want to address the three
main domains of musical prowess, the technical aspect of being able to
play (addressed by fundamentals), and the two primary ways we determine
what to play, sight reading and playing by ear.</div>

        <div class="article-content">One of the cardinal sins of productivity is to do what has already been
done. But in my quest to test an isomorphic keyboard against the
traditional keyboard, I appear to have sinned. Isomorphic keyboards have existed since the the early nineteenth century
when an isomorphic layout was applied to the button accordions or
concertina.</div>
