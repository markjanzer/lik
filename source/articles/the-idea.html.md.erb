#The Idea

There may be a better way to design the piano.

It is known that to master an instrument you must learn to play it in
every key. The first key a new pianist will learn to play is the key of
C major. It is wonderfully simple: just play the white notes. But the
price of a simple C major comes at the cost of increased difficulty and
complexity for the other keys.

But why is the piano designed this way? At first it may appear that the
keyboard was made for beginners and we never took the training wheels
off, but this is not the case.

In 1361, Nicholas Faber designed an organ for Haberstaldt, Germany. This
organ is the first known application of the traditional keyboard layout
we know and use today. A couple significant musical advances occurred
between the invention of the Haberstaldt keyboard (which I will call the
traditional keyboard) and its implementation on the first piano 350
years later.

Equal temperament was discovered in 1584, which meant that an instrument
could be tuned in a way that would allow it to play in any key. Before
equal temperament, instruments could only be tuned to play in one
key.<sup>1</sup>

Throughout the 17th century, Western music transitioned from modality to
tonality. To put it way too simply, one of the effects of this switch to
tonality was that people wanted to play in more than one key.<sup>2</sup>

The traditional keyboard layout is perfect if you only want to play in C
major. The traditional keyboard layout was not designed for beginners,
but for a different musical era.

So how can we improve the keyboard? Remove the C major bias and make all
keys equally difficult to play?

We can do better. Make all keys equal, and in the process, make all keys
the same.

This is the Linear Isomorphic Keyboard.

The term isomorphism, when applied to musical instruments, means that
any distinct musical phrase---be it a chord or a sonata---can be played
the same way regardless of the note that it starts on.<sup>3</sup>

What does this mean? On the linear isomorphic keyboard (LIK) there is
one way to play all of the major scales. You don't learn to play *a*
major scale, you learn how to play *the* major scale. There is one way
to play a perfect fifth, instead of four.<sup>4</sup> If you can play "FÃ¼r Elise"
in one key, you can play it in every key.

This has been done before. There are plenty of isomorphic keyboards.
Most of them feature a grid of square or hexagonal tiles, with the
relation between adjacent tiles determined by particular intervals. But
I think that similarities the LIK shares with the traditional keyboard
<a href="/articles/other-isomorphic-keyboards">gives it an edge over other isomorphic keyboards</a>.

Even the LIK isn't a new concept. The keyboard [was patented in
1953](https://www.google.com/patents/US2627777), and last
year there was [a Kickstarter for a
prototype](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/176239/dodeka-music-finally-within-everyones-reach/)
courtesy of [Dodeka](http://www.dodeka.info/), but none
are currently available for purchase.

But the most important question about the LIK (and other isomorphic
keyboards) still demands an answer: Is it better than the traditional
keyboard?

I'm not sure. But I'm going to find out.

I'm performing an experiment, comparing my improvement on two keyboards:
the LIK and the traditional keyboard. I will practice the same content
for the same amount of time on each keyboard, record all of the practice
sessions, and periodically publish assessments. It is not a perfect
study, but I think the findings will still provide valuable insight about the viability of the LIK.

I have a couple goals in mind. First, I want to begin to fill the dearth
of studies comparing efficacy of the isomorphic keyboard to the
traditional keyboard. If I find the LIK to be superior to the
traditional keyboard, my next goals would be to gain publicity,
facilitate adoption, and encourage further research. Ideally, this would
incentivize companies with experience making musical keyboards to make
LIKs so I don't have to 3D print keys for the rest of my life.

If this is successful, we could collectively save the pianists around
the world countless of hours of practice. The piano would be easier and
more enjoyable to play. Pianists could spend less time on technique and
transposition and spend more time making music.

Stay tuned.

    sounds like to play in the wrong key on a non equal temperament keyboard:
    

2.  Discussion of the differences between modality and tonality as well
    as the transition between the two extends far beyond the scope of
    this article. And this statement is partially false because
    pre-tonality people played in modes, not keys, and they used
    harmonizations with notes that didn't occur in the key they played
    in (if they were playing in keys). To learn a little more check

    distinct musical performance is executed in the same way,
    regardless of key or location."

4.  The traditional keyboard has four different ways to play a perfect
    fifth: White key to white key (eg. C -\> G), white key to black
    key (eg. B -\> F\#), black key to white key (eg. Bb -\> F), and
    black key to black key (C\# -\> G\#). For more on this, check out <a href="/articles/the-experiment">this article</a>.
