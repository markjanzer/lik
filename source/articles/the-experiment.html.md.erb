#The Experiment

I am conducting an experiment to determine whether or not the Linear
Isomorphic Keyboard is easier to play than the traditional piano
keyboard.

##The Plan

In order to compare the Linear Isomorphic Keyboard (LIK) and the
traditional keyboard (TK), I am going to practice the same content on
both keyboards for the same amount of time, and record my practice
sessions. In addition to recording, I will be keeping track of my
proficiency with each exercise and publishing the data as I go. With the
practice routine set as a constant, I should be able to compare the
playability the keyboards.

Now here's a question that could be fun(damental to the integrity of the
experiment): how do you assess assess and compare the playability of two
musical instruments?

###Playability

Playability, or the ease of playing music on an instrument, is
determined by a few variables. The most important variable is the
musical content that is being played. A saxophone would have trouble
playing the multi-part harmonies of piano music, and a piano would have
trouble bending notes like a saxophone. Playability can only measured in
regard to the content that is being played.

Thus appears the first confounding variable of this experiment, the
content of the practice sessions. I will be playing piano music,
designed for the traditional keyboard that has been around hundreds of
years. I will not be playing music designed for the LIK (there is none).
This makes the assessment inherently easier for the traditional
keyboard. However, as I am considering the LIK as a potential
replacement, I think it is fair to assess the playability of the LIK on
content written for the keyboard it could potentially replace.

For a given set of musical content, playability can be measured as the
function of two variables, the presence of technical limitations, and
the rate of improvement.

###Technical Limitations

Technical limitations are manifested in musical patterns that are
practically impossible to play. Playing a large leap between two notes
with one hand at an astronomical tempo can be practically impossible.
Sure, maybe somebody in the world can do it, but for the rest of us it's
might as well be impossible. Playing a note beyond the range of the
keyboard is nigh impossible.

When evaluating the ability of instruments to play musical patterns,
technical limitations are bad. If the LIK couldn't play anything that
the traditional keyboard could, it would not even warrant the comparison
as a potential replacement.

I don't expect to find many technical limitations for the traditional
keyboard, because the content I'm practicing was written for the
traditional keyboard. Perhaps in the future there will be music that is
written for the LIK that is unplayable on the TK, but the music has yet
to be written, so the limitations will go relatively unexplored.

###The Rate of Improvement

The rate of improvement is important when evaluating the playability of
instruments. If there was an instrument with no limitations that could
play anything you think of instantaneously it would be a phenomenal
instrument. However, if it took 10,000 hours to just learn the C Major
scale, the same instrument would be considered useless or... unplayable.

On a more realistic spectrum, if people could learn to play a keyboard
twice as fast they would. If there was another instrument that could
play the same music as another instrument but took half the time to
learn, the latter would be replaced. We place value on time, so the
faster the rate of improvement the better.

Once again, the rate of improvement can be influenced by the
expectations that the written music is conforming to. Hannon wrote his
finger exercises for the traditional keyboard, so he only wrote music
for white notes. Because of this, I fully expect Hannon's exercises to
be more difficult for the LIK than the TK, so the LIK's improvement
might be slower.

##The Method

In order to compare the playability of both keyboards on, I am going to
practice the same content, for the same amount of time two keyboards of
equal quality. I have two Midiplus i61 keyboard controllers. I have
altered one of them to be a LIK; I replaced all of the keys with black
keys, added 3d printed extensions to make the keys longer, and I sawed
off bits on the back of the keys to keep action consistent across all
keys.

Using the same basic keyboard is a good control for the quality of the
instruments, but the practice session is a bit more difficult to
control.

###Controlling the practice sessions

If I were to keep practice sessions exactly the same between keyboards,
it would be unfair to the keyboard that was more advanced and thus
inaccurate. For instance, if I practiced the first Hannon exercise at 60
bpm for 20 minutes on the LIK, I shouldn't be forced to do the same on
the traditional keyboard. The TK could have a much easier time with that
exercise, making it a waste of time to practice for as long as the LIK.
The keyboard that is behind would get optimized practice sessions, while
the more advanced keyboard would have to practice things that don't
benefit it nearly as much.

The other extreme would be to have no specified curriculum and let each
keyboard practice whatever I believe to be the best thing for that
keyboard at the time. This is clearly flawed, because now the quality of
the practiced content is now a confounding variable.

This experiment is going to use the middleground. There is a specified
curriculum that both keyboards share. The practice material is be broken
down into three main domains of musical prowess: fundamentals, sight
reading, and playing by ear. Within these domains there are sets of
exercises. For instance, in fundamentals, the sets are scales and
arpeggios, Hannon's finger exercises, and Slonimsky's Thesaurus of
Scales and Musical Patterns. In order to be fair without being limiting,
each keyboard will practice the sets of exercises for the same amount of
time, but which exercises they play and the difficulty at which they
practice the exercise are left to my discretion. This limits the content
of the practice session, controls for the quality of the exercises, and
still lets each keyboard practice what is best for it.

You can find out more about the curriculum and the reasoning behind it
here **link to the Practice Routine**.

###Evaluation

**Revise this point onwards**

By the end of this experiment, I will have data that shows how long I
played each exercise on each keyboard, what difficulty I can play any
given exercise at, and how much practice it took me get to any given
difficulty of any exercise on each keyboard. Using this data, I should
not only be able to determine how proficient I am at the end of the
experiment, but I should be able to measure my rate of improvement for
each exercise, and identify technical limitations.

I hope that with this data, I will be able to come to a conclusion about
the playability of the linear isomorphic keyboard and how it compares to
the traditional keyboard.

##The Flaws

In order for me to assert that the experiment can have a meaningful
result in spite of its flaws, I need to show that I'm aware of the
flaws. And there are plenty of flaws.

The study is not blind (let alone double blind) and only has one
participant who is most certainly biased (I think the LIK is awesome). I
don't know how much of my improvement on the LIK will be a result of
transferable skills on the TK or vice versa. The exercises that I will
be practicing for fundamentals were created for the traditional
keyboard, and they might not have the same beneficial impact for the
LIK^1^. Also, because the exercises were written for the TK, I only
expect to find technical limitations for the LIK. In addition, at the
outset of the experiment, I will be better at the TK than I will at the
LIK, I have played the piano on and off since I was seven, while I have
played the LIK for no more than twenty minutes (I couldn't resist). I'm
not sure what effect this might have.

Another confounding factor will be my own skills as they will be a
limitation for the performance for both keyboards. My ability to play
any scale quickly might not be limited by my comfort with the
fingerings, but instead by my ability to play anything that quickly. My
ability to play either keyboard by ear is limited by my own ear. It
might be much easier on one keyboard than the other, but I can't
remember four measures of music then I won't be able to play it
regardless. The same goes for sight reading.

The varying incremental difficulties of exercises is a confounding
variable when assessing the keyboards purely by number of difficulty
increments played by each keyboard. This confounding variable is removed
when both keyboards have played the same increment. Perhaps increasing
the ambitus when sight reading is far more challenging than increasing
the tempo, but both the ambitus increase and the tempo increase are
viewed as one increment. As long as both keyboards play this it won't be
a confounding variable. It'll make assessment at the end when one
keyboard has gotten further in the curriculum less convincing

The last confounding variable is the benefit of transferable skills or
other delayed improvement within one keyboard. Perhaps I'm having
trouble playing the C Major scale any faster than 100 bpm. While
practicing Hannon's The Virtuoso Pianist, I am going to be inadvertently
practicing a lot of C major patterns. Or perhaps I got some great REM
sleep and I practiced in my dreams. Either way, I could improve at the C
Major scale, and this improvement could go unnoticed until I revisit it
(or perhaps until the final evaluation). The result would be that the
rates of improvement that could be somewhat inaccurate when not taking
into account the entire experiment. For instance, it might look like
there is an incredible wave of improvement in one week on a keyboard,
but it might be from me revisiting old material and finding that I've
improved.

###The caveats

There are a couple factors that will help control against a few of these
flaws. The varying difficulties of increments is controlled for when
comparing the content that both keyboards have practiced. It doesn't
matter if it is far harder to go from 60 to 63 bpm than from 72 to 72
bpm for a particular exercise if both keyboards end up playing up to
those speeds. Perhaps improvement will be slower from 60 to 63 bpm, but
I will still be able to compare the rates of improvement between the two
keyboards.

Then there is the confounding variable of transferable skills, how my
skills on one keyboard might help the other. This can be partially
controlled for by evaluating the improvements between keyboards once
their skills in a particular exercise match. For instance, I expect my
experience on the traditional keyboard to hasten my improvement on the
LIK; if I had never played the piano, it would take me comparatively
longer to get better at the LIK. However, once I can play an exercise at
the same level of difficulty on each keyboard, this benefit is somewhat
nullified. From that point, if one keyboard has a faster rate of
improvement than the other, I am not going to attribute it to my worse
skill on the other keyboard.

##In Conclusion

There are a lot of flaws and confounding variables in this experiment,
several being theoretically disadvantageous to the LIK. I think that if
the difference between the rate of improvement is great enough, the
findings of this experiment will carry weight.

1.  Long-tones are an exercise essential for wind instruments, in which
    the instrumentalist sustains a note to improve their tone quality.
    This exercise is not nearly as useful on the piano as pianists do
    not have control over sustained tone. This is an extreme example,
    but it illustrates that exercises might not benefit each
    instrument equally.
      It is not clear whether or not Hannon's finger exercises for piano
    will provide the same benefit the LIK as they will the traditional
    piano, or if the LIK will benefit from practicing scales and arpeggios
    for the same amount of time as the traditional keyboard. This could
    theoretically put the LIK at a disadvantage, but whether it actually
    will and to what extent will be difficult to determine.
