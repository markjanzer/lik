# The Experiment

I am conducting an experiment to determine whether or not the Linear Isomorphic Keyboard is easier to play than the traditional piano keyboard.

## The Plan

In order to compare the Linear Isomorphic Keyboard (LIK) and the traditional keyboard (TK), I am going to practice the same content on both keyboards for the same amount of time and record my practice sessions. In addition, I will be keeping track of my proficiency with each exercise and publishing the results as I go. With the practice routine as a constant, I should be able to compare the playability the keyboards.

Before I dive into how I will compare playability, first I must answer the question: what is playability?

## Defining Playability

I define playability of an instrument as the ease of performance on that instrument with a given set of music.

It is important to note that playability can only be measured in regard to the content that is being played. A saxophone would have trouble playing the multi-part harmonies of piano music, and a piano would have trouble bending notes like a saxophone. Both instruments have a plethora of music they can play with ease, but when assessed on other instruments' music they can appear to be unplayable.

Thus appears the first confounding variable of this experiment: the content of the practice sessions. I will be playing piano music, written for the traditional keyboard, but I will not be playing music written for the LIK (there is none). This might make it easier for the TK to play pieces written for it (such as Hanon, which has most of its exercises in the key of C major). However, as I am measuring the quality of the LIK as a replacement for the TK, I think it is fair to assess the playability of the LIK with content written for the keyboard it is replacing.

## Assessing Playability

For a given set of musical content, playability can be measured by the presence of technical limitations, and the rate of improvement.

### Technical Limitations

Technical limitations are in musical patterns that are practically impossible to play for the instrument. Pianos cannot bend notes like a saxophone, thus if you were comparing the two this would be a technical limitation. A technical limitation of the saxophone would be polyphony, as it can only play one note at a time. Notes outside of the range of the keyboard reveal the technical limitations of a piano. Playing multi-note melodies on a saxophone is impossible, and would be considered a technical limitation.

When evaluating the ability of instruments to play musical patterns, technical limitations are bad. If the LIK couldn't play anything that the traditional keyboard could, it would not warrant the comparison as a potential replacement.

When music is written for an instrument, the composer usually keeps technical limitations in mind and writes around them. This is why I don't expect to find many technical limitations for the traditional keyboard: the content I'm practicing was written for the traditional keyboard. Perhaps in the future there will be music that is written for the LIK that is unplayable on the TK, but the music has yet to be written, so the technical limitations of the TK will go relatively unexplored.

### The Rate of Improvement

The rate of improvement is important when evaluating the playability of instruments. If there was an instrument with no technical limitations that could play anything you think of instantaneously, it would be a phenomenal instrument. However, if it took 10,000 hours to just learn to play the C major scale, the same instrument would be considered unplayable.

For a slightly more realistic example, imagine two instruments, instruments A and B. There is no difference between these instruments except that people improve twice as fast practicing B as they do practicing A. Because it is easier to learn and perform B, I would consider B more playable than A.

Once again, the rate of improvement is influenced by the expectations that the written music is conforming to. Hannon wrote his finger exercises for the traditional keyboard, so he only wrote music for white notes. Because of this, I fully expect Hannon's exercises to be more difficult for the LIK than the TK, so the LIK's improvement might be slower.

## Comparing Playability

In order to compare the playability of both keyboards on, I am going to practice the same content, for the same amount of time two keyboards of equal quality. I have two Midiplus i61 keyboard controllers. I have altered one of them to be a LIK; I replaced all of the keys with black keys, added 3D printed extensions to make the keys longer, and I sawed off bits on the back of the keyboard to keep action consistent across all keys.

Using the same basic keyboard provides control over the quality of the instruments, but the practice session is a bit more difficult keep consistent.

### Controlling the practice sessions

I made a practice curriculum that both keyboards share. The material is be broken down into three main domains of musical prowess: fundamentals, sight reading, and playing by ear. Within these domains there are sets of exercises. For instance, in fundamentals there are three sets of exercises: scales and arpeggios, Hanon's finger exercises, and Slonimsky's Thesaurus of Scales and Musical Patterns.

In order to be fair without being limiting, each keyboard will practice the sets of exercises for the same amount of time, but the specific exercises they play and the difficulty at which they practice the exercise are left to my discretion.

I could choose to keep the practice sessions exactly the same between keyboards, but it would be unfair to the keyboard that was more advanced. For instance, if I practiced the first Hanon exercise at 60 bpm for 20 minutes on the LIK, I shouldn't be forced to do the same on the traditional keyboard. The TK could have a much easier time with the exercise, making it a waste of time to practice for as long as the LIK might. The keyboard that is behind would get optimized practice sessions, while the more advanced keyboard would have to practice exercises that don't benefit it nearly as much.

I also could choose to have no shared curriculum and instead let each keyboard practice whatever I believe to be best for that keyboard at the time. This is clearly flawed, because it would be much harder to measure and compare rates of improvement, and because the quality of the exercises practiced on each keyboard would be a confounding variable.

Ultimately, I think that this shared curriculum with the same amount of time allotted to each domain of musical expertise is the best way to allow for both flexibility and fairness.

## Evaluation

By the end of the experiment, I will have data that shows how long I played each exercise on each keyboard, what difficulty I can play any given exercise at, and how much practice it took me get to any given difficulty of any exercise on each keyboard. Using this data, I should not only be able to determine how proficient I am at the end of the experiment, but I should be able to measure my rate of improvement for each exercise, and identify technical limitations. You can see this data live [here](https://linearisomorphickeyboard.com/progress/).

I hope that with this data, I will be able to come to a conclusion about the playability of the Linear Isomorphic Keyboard and how it compares to the traditional keyboard.

## The Flaws

In order to have any confidence in the results of the experiment, I need to be aware of the shortcomings of the experiment, and there are plenty of flaws that are substantial enough to deserve recognition.

The study is not blind and only has one participant who is most certainly biased (I think the LIK is awesome). I don't know how much of my improvement on the LIK will be a result of transferable skills on the TK or vice versa. The exercises that I will be practicing for fundamentals were created for the traditional keyboard, and they might not have the same beneficial impact for the LIK.[^1] Also, because the exercises were written for the TK, I only expect to find technical limitations for the LIK. In addition, at the outset of the experiment, I will be better at the TK than I will at the LIK; I have played the piano on and off since I was seven, while I played the LIK for no more than twenty minutes before the first assessment (I couldn't resist).

Another confounding factor will be my own skills, as they can be a limitation for the performance for both keyboards. My ability to play any scale quickly might not be limited by my comfort with the fingerings, but instead by my ability to play anything that quickly. My ability to play either keyboard by ear is limited by my own ear. It might be much easier on one keyboard than the other, but if I can't remember the notes that are played, neither keyboard will do well.

The varying incremental difficulties of exercises is a confounding variable when assessing the keyboards purely by number of difficulty increments played by each keyboard. This confounding variable is removed when both keyboards have played the same increment. Both increasing the ambius and increasing tempo are considered one increment in sight reading, but perhaps increasing the ambitus is far more challenging than increasing the tempo. However it should be noted that this is only a confounding variable is unconfounded when both keyboards complete an increment. If it is a difficult increment to complete, we will still be able to see the difference in the time it took to complete the interval between keyboards.

The last confounding variable is the benefit of transferable skills or other delayed improvement within one keyboard. Perhaps I'm having trouble playing the C major scale any faster than 100 bpm. While practicing Hanon's The Virtuoso Pianist, I am going to be inadvertently practicing a lot of C major patterns. I could improve at the C major scale, and this improvement could go unnoticed until I revisit it, or it could make it look like I'm improving at the C major scale without much practice.

## Conclusion

I have defined playability as the ability to perform a given set of music, measured by technical ceilings and rate of improvement. The experiment I'm running will use the same curriculum for both keyboards, and offer some flexibility in regards to what is practiced on each keyboard in order to keep practice sessions fair, flexible, and measurable. There are flaws and confounding variables in the experiment that are important to consider when analyzing the results. Despite the flaws, I think that the results of this experiment will still be meaningful, and perhaps enough so to teach us about the performance of isomorphic keyboards and encourage more sounds experiments.

[^1]: Long-tones are an exercise essential for wind instruments, in which the instrumentalist sustains a note to improve their tone quality. This exercise is not nearly as useful on the piano as pianists do not have control over sustained tone. This is an extreme example, but it illustrates that exercises might not benefit each instrument equally. It is not clear whether or not Hannon's finger exercises for piano will provide the same benefit the LIK as they will the traditional piano, or if the LIK will benefit from practicing scales and arpeggios for the same amount of time as the traditional keyboard. This could theoretically put the LIK at a disadvantage, but whether it actually will and to what extent will be difficult to determine.
