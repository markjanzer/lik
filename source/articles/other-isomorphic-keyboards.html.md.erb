# Other Isomorphic Keyboards

One of the cardinal sins of productivity is to do what has already been
done. But in my quest to test an isomorphic keyboard against the
traditional keyboard, I appear to have sinned.

Isomorphic keyboards have existed since the the early nineteenth century
when an isomorphic layout was applied to the button accordions or
concertina.<sup>1</sup> [Many](http://daskin.com/page2/page2.html)
[different](http://www.shiverware.com/musixpro/)
[isomorphic](https://chromatone.jp/online-shop/index.html)
[keyboards](http://www.lippenskeyboard.com/purchase/) can
be purchased today, but instead of purchasing someone else's, I designed
and built my own.

But I would argue that I am not a sinner. Well, at least in this
particular instance.

## The Similarity Advantage

The similarities the LIK shares with the traditional keyboard make the
LIK easier to adopt in comparison to other isomorphic keyboards. This
advantage manifests itself in two aspects of adopting the LIK.

## Ease of playing

The likeness of the keyboards make the LIK easier for pianists to play,
as the skills needed to play the LIK are more transferable with the
traditional keyboard than the skills needed for other isomorphic
keyboards.

Other isomorphic keyboards have a two dimensional grid-like structure
composed of squares or hexagons. Each key maintains a particular
intervallic relationship between itself and adjacent keys. For instance,
on the Wicki-Hayden layout, any given key is surrounded by six other
keys. The key above and to the left is a fourth higher, the key above
and to the right is a fifth higher, and the key to the right is a whole
step higher.<sup>2</sup> Different isomorphic keyboards generally have different
interval relationships between adjacent keys.

To compare performance on keyboards, here is one octave of the C major
scale played with the right hand, with the fingers numbered as such: 1
-- thumb, 2 -- index, 3 -- middle, 4 -- ring, 5 -- pinkie. This is the
most common fingering, shared between six of the twelve major scales.

**Janko**: 1-2-3-(shift hand back)-1-2-3-4-(shift hand forward)-1

The LIK and the traditional keyboard share nearly identical shapes and
identical fingerings, while the other isomorphic keyboards require the
pianist to shift forward on a completely new plane (the sagittal plane).
I am not claiming that the LIK has better fingerings than the other
isomorphic layouts, but that the similarities to the traditional
keyboard will make it easier to adopt.

## Ease of creation

The LIK is much easier to create than other isomorphic keyboards,
because you don't have to start from scratch.

When creating your own isomorphic keyboard, you have to create the case,
the keys, the action for the keys, velocity sensitivity, wiring for the
triggers, and more. If you are DIY-inclined,
[this](http://rainboard.shiverware.com/Rainboard_-_DIY_Dynamic_Rainbow_Isomorphic_Keyboard)
is an awesome project. But for the rest of us, the process of making an
LIK is much more appealing, because instead of creating the keyboard
from scratch, you buy a keyboard, open it up, and replace the keys.

Okay it isn't *that* simple. Someone has to create the keys, and mass producing keys be difficult/expensive. I made mine by buying replacement black keys ($25 + shipping), and then 3D printing extensions for the black keys ($360). It ends up being expensive and time intensive to improve a $100 keyboard. I have some ideas for making the LIK more accessible but initially I'm going to focus on the experiment itself. If the LIK proves to be an improvement then I'll be focusing more on making it accessible to the public.

The LIK also will be easy for manufacturers to make. They could create
the new key (by altering the model of their black keys to have the
length of the white keys), and apply those keys to an existing keyboard.
Creating a new product is never a small undertaking, but the
infrastructure the LIK shares with the traditional keyboard should make it easier to produce.

## Conclusion

I have no reason to believe that the LIK is inherently superior to other
isomorphic keyboards. But in a world dominated by the traditional
keyboard, its similarity to the norm uniquely positions the LIK to be
the isomorphic keyboard that disrupts the reign of the traditional
keyboard.
