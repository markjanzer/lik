#The Hypotheses

I think that the linear isomorphic keyboard (LIK) will outperform the
traditional keyboard (TK). I predict that I will improve faster on the
LIK than on the traditional keyboard and that the LIK will not have
significant technical limitations in comparison to the traditional
keyboard. More specifically, I hypothesize that the LIK will outperform
the TK on fundamentals, be slightly better at sight reading, and greatly
outperform the TK when playing by ear.

The reasonings behind these hypotheses are based on yet another
hypothesis: I believe that isomorphic keyboards have an advantage over
non-isomorphic keyboards in regards to playability.

##The Isomorphic Instruments

When applied to the keyboard, "Isomorphism applied to musical
instruments means that every distinct musical performance is executed in
the same way, regardless of key or location."^1\ 2^ Each musical pattern
only has one shape, regardless of key or location. The LIK and other
(equal temperament) isomorphic keyboards have another quality: each
shape correlates to one musical pattern.^3^

This one-to-one correlation of shapes to sounds provides an advantage
for the LIK. The implications are far reaching and amorphous, but I have
done my best to break the idea down into three advantages the
transpositional, the observational, and the rudimentary.

###The transpositional advantage

The most obvious benefit of isomorphism is that transposition becomes as
simple as shifting your hand. On non-isomorphic keyboards, each musical
idea can have up to twelve different shapes, or twelve different ways to
play it depending on the starting note. On the LIK, there is a one to
one relationship between musical ideas and shapes.

Practice one scale and you practice all twelve. Learn a solo and you can
play it in any key. Practice a musical motif and you will have practiced
it's every appearance in that song, regardless of transposition. The
transpositional benefit does not mean that the content is not that it's
easier to play, but that there is less to learn. You learn the same
amount of music, but one twelfth the shapes.

But it isn't quite 1/12th the amount of shapes. It is 1/12 the different
combinations of shapes, but certain keys are pretty similar. When it
comes down to it, there aren't 1/12th the amount of patterns to learn on
the LIK. There is between 1/3rd and 1/4th. Because although there are 12
different combinations of intervals, there are only 28 different shapes
for intervals in a given octave. Breaking this all down to the interval
makes more sense. For LIK its 1-1. POOOP. I think it's LCS time.


###The observational advantage

The irregular pattern of the TK makes the notes easier to recognize at
the cost of obfuscating musical patterns. You can identify a note using
both the color of the key and it's location within the irregular
pattern, but now there can be up to twelve different shapes for any
given pattern.

Isomorphic keyboards remove the irregular patterns, making it more
difficult to recognize individual notes as shape no longer helps
identify notes. However, the one-to-one correlation between shapes and
musical patterns does two things. it makes it easier to determine
musical patterns from shapes, and it makes it easier to generate shapes
for musical patterns.

Isomorphism helps determine musical patterns from shapes. You might not
know that F\# to a Bb is a major 3rd, but you could recognize the shape.
If you didn't catch the similarities between two melodies on paper, you
can see and feel the interval of a major 3rd, and it will look/feel like
every other major third.

Isomorphism can make it easier to determine which shapes to play for a
given musical pattern. If I see a F minor 7 chord, I don't have to
calculate the flats and sharps (none) of the chord, I can play a minor 7
chord that starts on F.

These create the observational advantage, making it is easier to
identify and apply music theory to the keyboard.

###The rudimentary advantage

The rudimentary advantage is the transpositional advantage applied at
the intervallic level. Melodies and harmonies can be broken down into
collections of intervals. On the traditional keyboard, every interval
has between two and four different associated shapes (except for unison,
which has one), with the median being four^4^. Every shape has a median
of two sounds, meaning when you perform in one way, it could make two
separate sounds.

The one-to-one relationship between shapes and sounds will make the LIK
far easier to play, especially when playing by ear. When learning the
piano, our brain is creating associations between the physical sensation
of playing a musical pattern and sonic response. On the traditional
keyboard, this relationship is confounded, as there is no one-to-one
relationship. Then context must be learned, and each of these
associations need to be contextualized within the twelve different
possible starting notes.

I think that this simpler pairing physical sensation and sonic feedback
will make it easier for pianists to learn all of the intervals---the
building blocks of melody and harmony---and thus make it significantly
easier to translate musical ideas into our head into physical
performances.

##How the benefits of isomorphism apply to the hypothesis

Now that I have covered the hypotheses of the benefits of isomorphism in
regard to playability, I am going to apply them as the reasoning for my
hypotheses for the experiment.

###Fundamentals

I think that I will improve faster on the fundamentals primarily because
of the transpositional advantage. Scales won't be easier to play on the
isomorphic keyboard, but there are one twelfth the amount of shapes to
learn to play all of the scales. In addition, chromatic
ascending/descending patterns will be easier to learn because once the
first iteration of the pattern is learned, the other iterations will
have the same shape.

###Sight reading

I think that the LIK and TK will perform equally well at sight reading.
This is particularly difficult for me to predict, due to the complexity
of sight reading. The TK seems to have advantages specific to sight
reading, while the isomorphic advantages of the LIK make the playability
easier.

At first glance, the TK has two notable advantages.

The first is the fact that Western notation system is designed around
the key of C (like the traditional keyboard). Notes outside of the C
major scale are decorated with an accidental. Thus any note without an
accidental will be a white key, while most notes with accidentals will
be black keys. This pairing of the colors and shapes of the keys with
accidentals and naturals could potentially be an advantage for
traditional keyboards.

The other advantage is the tactile information that the TK provides. The
irregular shape of the keys on a TK allows the player to know what notes
they are playing by touch alone (irrespective of the octave). This
tactile feedback can help sight reading, allowing the player to keep
track of their hands while watching the sheet music.

To understand the potential advantage of the LIK, imagine sight reading
as a three step process.

1.  Written music -\> Brain. The first step, you read the sheet music
    > and internalize what notes to play when (the keyboard is not a
    > factor).

2.  Brain -\> Imagined fingering. In the second step, you determine
    > which keys to press to play the given notes. I think the TK will
    > have an advantage here.

3.  Imagined fingering -\> Performance. The final step is actually
    > playing the notes. I think that the LIK will have an advantage in
    > this last step, as the musical patterns you are playing will be
    > roughly twelve times more familiar.

This argument is rather weak. It wouldn't be a stretch to consider step
three to be confounding variable for what we really want to test with
sight reading, step 2. Step three is already tested with the practice of
fundamentals. Perhaps most of the challenges in sight reading are not in
step three, but instead in step two and one. Maybe the ease of three
will lessen the cognitive load, allowing for better performance at steps
one and two, but this is all highly speculative. The one thing I do
know, is that there are a few things I don't know that might help sight
reading with the LIK.

The second advantage I stated the TK has is the fact that from tactile
information alone you can tell where you are and what notes you are
playing on the keyboard. The question I have is how much is this tactile
information necessary for experienced pianists? It is clear that
initially it is very helpful to determine where you are, but I could
imagine that if one were to get very good at a keyboard, they could
determine where they are from the accuracy of their hand movements
alone. I am inexperienced on the LIK, so I can't be sure of how far I
shifted my hand until I play a note. Perhaps when I become more
advanced, I will be able to navigate the LIK with ease, and the tactile
feedback of the TK will become negligible.

The other two questions about LIK performance have to do with chunking.
Chunking is the the process by which individual pieces of information
are bound together into meaningful chunks. When you read the notes C, E,
and G, you can chunk them into a C major triad. It is less to store in
working memory when sight reading, and even easier to play. Instead of
thinking of playing the individual notes, you can query your muscle
memory for a C major triad.

The first question is, will the performance of these chunks be easier
from due to the transpositional advantage? Perhaps instead of querying
your muscle memory for the the C major triad, you will search for the
major triad, starting on C. Since there is only one way to play the
major triad, you only need determine the starting note.

The second question is, will playing the LIK change the way that we
chunk music? I read music differently when playing the saxophone as
opposed to the keyboard, and I wonder if---due to the ease of
performance of musical patterns---the LIK will encourage us to chunk in
different, and perhaps more efficient ways. Perhaps on the LIK it will
be more beneficial for us to chunk D, E, F\#, G\# as four notes of a
whole tone scale. Notes are easier to identify on the TK, and musical
patterns are easier to identify on the LIK. It is possible that the LIK
will more strongly reward the player for thinking of music as a web of
musical patterns rather than a cluster of notes, and that this chunking
will be an advantage for sight reading.

Ultimately, there are a lot of unknowns and any prediction I make will
be highly speculative. So here's my highly speculative prediction: the
TK will outperform the LIK initially, but as I improve at the LIK, the
TK's advantages would disappear and the strength of the third step of
sight reading will make the LIK a slightly better instrument for sight
reading.

###Playing by ear

I think that the rudimental advantage of isomorphic keyboards will make
playing by ear significantly easier on the LIK than on the traditional
piano. The fact that you have to learn one twelfth the amount of ways to
play any given interval, and that there is no context switching
depending on the starting note means that the LIK will be superior at
interfacing musical concepts to real sounds.

##Conclusion

To conclude, here is the collection of all of my hypotheses.

The one-to-one relationship between shapes and notes will make the LIK
easier to play than the TK. Transposition will be easier, musical
patterns will be easier to recognize and apply, and

The transpositional advantage will make fundamentals on the LIK improve
faster than the TK. The LIK might slightly outperform the TK due to
advantages in pattern recognition, although the TK does have advantages
of its own. Finally, I will be far better at playing by ear on the LIK
because t

How do I describe the rudimentary advantage. Any musical pattern will be
easier to play because it will be more recognizable.

The similarity between

**I need to rethink the rudimentary advantage. Maybe the advantages in
general.**

1.  [["Isomorphism applied to musical instruments means that every
    distinct musical performance is executed in the same way,
    regardless of key or
    location."]{.underline}](http://smcnetwork.org/system/files/smc2011_submission_169.pdf)

2.  There are competing definitions of isomorphism, and according to
    some the LIK isn't truly isomorphic. Wikipedia's definition
    [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic\_keyboard]{.underline}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic_keyboard)
    , which I assume uses this article as a source
    [[https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15]{.underline}](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15)
    asserts that isomorphic keyboards must be tuning invariant, which
    the LIK is not (the LIK is only isomorphic for equal tone
    temperaments). I intend on exploring this more fully in another
    article.

3.  Geometry or shape, when applied to keyboards describes the shape
    made by the physical location of the keys. Fingering describes
    which fingers hit which notes. There is correlation between the
    two; generally one shape will be fingered one way. However, this
    is not always true. You can play the first five notes of the C
    major scale with all five fingers (1-2-3-4-5) but if you were had
    to complete the scale, you would finger the same shape as
    (1-2-3-1-2) so that you could finish the scale with 3-4-5. **show
    image demonstrating this here**. Realistically, change in
    fingerings for a particular shape are dependent on what has been
    played prior or what needs to be played immediately after.

4.  Reflections on the advantages of isomorphic keyboards (notably 1-1
    isomorphic keyboards).
